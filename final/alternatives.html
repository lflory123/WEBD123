            <h2>More Information</h2>
            <p>Being very lactose intolerant deprives some people of certain pleasures in life, specifically cheese and ice cream. We have found ways to reconcile the separation from cheese, namely some stellar vegan options and the occasional real cheese bender borne out of desperation. Ice cream, however, has become a nemesis. Mimicking the indulgent, creamy goodness of real dairy ice cream is nearly impossible. Milk is special, and ice cream is an exemplary demonstration of that uniqueness.</p>

            <h3>Challanges that lie ahead</h3>

                Creating a passable nondairy ice cream is a formidable challenge, primarily because the fat content of whole milk or heavy cream is what creates the rich, uniformly smooth and creamy texture of the best ice creams. Reduced or nonexistent milk fat will create an ice cream that feels thin and can be challenging to emulsify properly. Most milk in the U.S. is also homogenized, meaning the fat particles are evenly distributed throughout the other liquids. As you introduce air while mixing the ice cream base, the fat clusters break apart further but hold the air pockets in place. Stable air pockets make for a fluffier final product despite the density of the fat. Fat and water want to separate, so homogenization addresses this problem before you’ve even pulled out the ice cream maker. Moreover, fat means flavor. So not only does dairy fat keep the ice cream base uniform and fluffy, but without it, you’ll have an ice cream that tastes like slurry water instead of a sweet indulgence.</p>

                <h4>Strategies</h4>
                
                
                <p>The most successful strategies for making a truly dairy-free alternative foremost require replacing the fat source. Early versions of nondairy ice cream simply injected extra lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the lactose sugars in dairy, into the base. But let’s be honest, that’s cheating and only avoids the problem instead of solving it. For those with lactose allergies, not just sensitivities, or those adhering to vegan diets, lactase-addled ice creams don’t suffice.
                
                Luckily, alternative diets are stylish (and lucrative), and major brands from Ben & Jerry’s to local artisanal ice cream shops are creating delicious, dairy-free ice creams that are luxurious and delightful in their own right. To do so, they are using high-protein, high-fat replacements for traditional dairy milk. </p>
