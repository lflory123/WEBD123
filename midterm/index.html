        <h1>Welcome to the Exotic bird show</h1>
        <p>When I was a little girl I first saw an exotic bird in a bird show. It was amazing because I got to see up close the vibrant colors, their unique features and even what it looked like when they took off in flight. My Aunt was and still is the owner of these magestic birds.I got a up close experience. I got to hold them on my arm and touch their features. They were smooth, ruffley, long but powerfull. Their colors were bright and unique to each different type of bird, ranging from a large cackatoo to a small parakeet.</p>
        
        <p>I started to learn some things about these birds that were like pets to her. One was about their nutrition habits. Their diet not only consists of seeds but also of vegetation like vegetables, nuts, fruit. Even in the wild they have this variety to help their diet and keep them healthy. Another one was, they need a variety of textures to stand on and multiple different perches for their mental and physical health.But their are so many more things we can do for our featured friends like making sure they have enough room in their cages or making sure they are cleaned up after. They are high maintenance but fun to have around and have someone to talk to from time to time to. A cackatoo for example can say hi or hello. Here is how one looks like.</p>
