        <h4>"She is quirky, halarious but so adorable!"</h4>

        <p>I adore white cat breeds.I have a beautiful, white long haired cat.My first fact, which most people know is they are often deaf.I did not know how cat's actually act when they are half deaf until mine was. She always shows physical signs of it. Some are She was not respondng to everyday sounds, not noticing when you enter the house, not woken by loud noises and a major increase in sleep.</p>

        <p>Another one is that their are several all white cat breeds including Russian white cats and Ragdoll.They are all around us and so diverse. We see them in movies, tv and even books.My all time two are Duchess and Marie from the Aristocats. Which is why I always wanted one and am so happy to have my special cat snow.</p>
